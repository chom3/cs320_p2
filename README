Notes:
	My logic in some code was a little off so not all results matched correctly. 
	However, for a couple of runs, my output was actually higher than the correct output. 
	The fully associative cache with hot-cold approximation policies, set associative
	cache with next-line prefetching/prefetch-on-a-miss both don't work correctly. I tried to create
	a most recently used, which you can find in extracredit.cpp.
	
	To generate: g++ extracredit.cpp
	To use: ./a.out -input file- -output file-
