Notes:
	My logic in some code was a little off so not all results matched correctly. 
	However, for a couple of runs, my output was actually higher than the correct output. 
	The fully associative cache with hot-cold approximation policies, set associative
	cache with next-line prefetching/prefetch-on-a-miss both don't work correctly. I tried to create
	a most recently used, which you can find in extracredit.cpp.
	Notes about the extra credit:
	I read in some file that MRU is just the opposite of an LRU cache. 
	So I tried to just "flip" everything in the LRU, which obviously didn't work.
	Interestingly, as the size of the cache associativity increased, the 
	performance decreased.
	To run the extracredit, it is already generated by the make command.
	Use ./extracredit -input- -output-
	Like you would for the cache simulator.
